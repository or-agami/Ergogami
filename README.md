# Ergogami Keyboard
This keyboard powered by [ZMK](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk), PCB board layout generated by [Ergogen](https://github.com/ergogen/ergogen), Gerber files generated by [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/).

Ergogami keyboard is a fully wireless split keyboard with 3*5 columns keys and 3 thumb keys.
I realized that I'm moving my fingers away from the homebrow a lot in "regular" keyboards and I tried to make a keyboard with minimal movement without compromise the keys behavior
